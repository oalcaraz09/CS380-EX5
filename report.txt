	A pcap application is layed out in 5 stages. Stage 1 is to determine on what interface the sniffing will be done on. Stage 2 is telling pcap what device the sniffing will be done on. Sniffing can be done on multiple devices by using file handles to distinguish between device. Stage 3 is a three-step process that allows sniffing on specific traffic. The three steps are to create a rule set, "compile" it, and apply it. Stage 4 is entering is entering pcaps's primary exec loop, receive however many packets, and everytime a new packet is received, it is used however the user wants. Stage 5 is acheived onced the sniffing is satisfied.
